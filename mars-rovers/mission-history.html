    <h2> So What's The History?</h2>
    <h3>Curiosity Mission History</h3>
        <p><i></i>The Curiosity Rover<sup><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> was launched as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, with the goal of exploring the Gale Crater on Mars to study its climate, geology, and search for signs of ancient life. </p>
        <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> November 26, 2011</p>
        <p><strong>Landing Date:</strong> August 6, 2012</p>
        <p><strong>Mission Analysis:</strong> Curiosity was sent to explore the Gale Crater on Mars, studying its climate, geology, and assessing whether Mars has ever had the conditions necessary to support microbial life. The rover was equipped with a variety of tools designed to study the atmosphere, rocks, and soil.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Accomplishments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>First successful landing of a rover on Mars using the "skycrane" landing system.</li>
          <li>Discovered evidence of ancient water flows in Gale Crater.</li>
          <li>Confirmed the presence of organic molecules in the Martian soil.</li>
          <li>Sent the first high-definition video footage of Mars.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Curiosity is still actively exploring Mars, continuing to send valuable data back to Earth as it moves across the Martian surface.</p>
    
    
        <h3>Perseverance Mission History</h3>
            <p>The Perseverance rover, part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission, aims to search for signs of ancient life, collect samples for future return missions, and test new technologies for future exploration.</p>
            <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> July 30, 2020</p>
        <p><strong>Landing Date:</strong> February 18, 2021</p>
        <p><strong>Mission Analysis:</strong> Perseverance was sent to Mars with a primary goal of searching for signs of ancient life and collecting samples for future return missions. It landed in the Jezero Crater, which scientists believe may have once held a lake. Perseverance is also testing new technology, such as the Ingenuity helicopter.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Accomplishments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Successfully landed in the Jezero Crater using the "skycrane" system.</li>
          <li>Sent back the first sound recordings from the surface of Mars.</li>
          <li>Collected rock and soil samples that will be returned to Earth by a future mission.</li>
          <li>Tested the Mars Helicopter (Ingenuity), which made the first controlled flight on another planet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Perseverance is still actively exploring Mars, collecting data, and preparing samples for future missions aimed at bringing them back to Earth for study.</p>
